# buzzfeed
A snarky buzzfeed headline generator.


## API
Have an idea that will make buzzfeed... buzzfeedier? Awesome! Here's how to implement it.

* Functions should take advantage of the `word` function to get random plural words for headlines. For example, `word() + ' are fun!'` will return a random word followed by 'are fun!'.
* Use `str(num)` to get a random number. This is really useful for headlines like '26 Reasons Why Dogs Are Amazing!'.
* Add your function to the random dictionary. Basically just add 1 to the highest numbered key in `d` and use that as your key. The value should just be the name of your function (not in a string!).
* Create something Buzzfeed-y. Anything that I deem unBuzzfeedlike will not be accepted.
* Submit Pull Requests! Please.
